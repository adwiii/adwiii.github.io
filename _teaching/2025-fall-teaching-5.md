description: Developing software for robot systems is challenging as they must sense, represent, and actuate in the physical world. Sensing the physical world is usually noisy, the knowledge and representation of the world is incomplete and uncertain, and actuating in and on the world is often inaccurate. In this class, we will explore software engineering approaches to cope with those challenges. You will learn to use domain-specific abstractions, architectures, libraries, and validation approaches and tools to safely perform robot activities like motion, navigation, perception, planning, and interaction. The expectation is that this course will open up new career options in robotics for our students. The course requires no prior knowledge of robotics.
